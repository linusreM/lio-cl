# Lab IO card test package


This project contains testing/utility firmware for the **GD32VF** based development board and for the accompanying peripheral IO-card, designed for educational purposes at KTH.

The firmware consists of a command line interface from which you can test different functionality of the board.

## Using the firmware

To use the application load the program into the board under test. Then connect the board to your computer using the USB connector. Oopen up a serial terminal and connect to the board, usually /dev/ttyACM0 in linux. Baud rate should not matter since it is only emulating a serial adapter. 

Then press **k** when prompted to start the interpreter.

Run a command by typing it's name and pressing enter.

Arguments to functions are added by typing them after the command with a space as a separator.

Type **help** to see the available commands and their usage.

## Running scripts

Also included in this package (**scripts/**) are some example scripts using the command line to automate tasks.

To run a script you need **python 3** and **pySerial** installed.

When writing scripts make sure that each line sent is terminated by **\r** to trigger execution. Also make sure not to send commands faster than they can be consumed. The interpreter only buffers one command.

## Adding commands

The firmware is written so that it is easy to add new commands. To add a new command simply write a function in the form of
```c
    int example_command(int argc, char* argv[]);
```
**argc** will be the number of arguments supplied with the command. Arguments to the function are supplied as separate strings in **argv[]**. The first argument is always the name of the command. If you need for example an integer just parse the appropriate index in **argv[]** like:
```c
    n = itoa(argv[i]);
```
When you have written the command function add it to the **vector_table[]** array in the following form:
```c
    {"command-name", &example_command, 
     "[argument 1] [argument 2] How to use the command"},
```
Preferrably don't make the usage descriptions longer than a line. (~80 chars)
If you need to be able to convey more information on the usage consider using a -h flag in your command function to supply more info

That is all you need to do then just recompile and the new command should be available. It will also automatically have its own entry when you run **help**
